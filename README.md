## Launch Pad Part 1 (Countdown)

### Assignment Description

Today Ellen and I wrote code to make a countdown from 10 on the serial monitor. We did this to later incorporate into our final python assingment. 

### Evidence

### Code
[My code](raspberry-pi/Countdown.py).

### Reflection

We had some difficulty getting the countdown to count down from ten as apposed to counting up from 1 but other than that this task was pretty straight foward.

## Launch Pad Part 2 (Lights)

### Assignment Description

Today Ellen and I created code to make a red light flash as the serial monitor counts down from ten and then flashes a red light when the word 'launch' is printed. We wrote this code as a part of our 4pt pyhton assignment.

### Reflection

We struggled getting the correct to light up as we forgot to originally label our LEDS. Another issue we had is that one of our lights wasnt working and we thought it was our code originally. 

## Launch Pad Part 3 (Button)

### Assignment Description

Today Ellen and I created code to make the coundown and lights start when we press a button. This is for our 4pt pyhton assignment.

### Evidence

### Reflection

We didnt have too many issues with this assignment as it was pretty straight foward. It took us a little to figure out the correct commands to correctly use the button with our pre-existing code.

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
