## Launch_Pad_Part_1_(Countdown)

### Assignment Description

Today Ellen and I wrote code to make a countdown from 10 on the serial monitor. We did this to later incorporate into our final python assingment. 

### Evidence 

![Countdown](https://github.com/gdaless20/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/images/Untitled.mp4)  

### Code
[My code](raspberry-pi/Countdown.py).

### Reflection

We had some difficulty getting the countdown to count down from ten as apposed to counting up from 1 but other than that this task was pretty straight foward.

## Launch Pad Part 2 (Lights)

### Assignment Description

Today Ellen and I created code to make a red light flash as the serial monitor counts down from ten and then flashes a red light when the word 'launch' is printed. We wrote this code as a part of our 4pt pyhton assignment.

### Evidence

### Reflection

We struggled getting the correct to light up as we forgot to originally label our LEDS. Another issue we had is that one of our lights wasnt working and we thought it was our code originally. 

## Launch Pad Part 3 (Button)

### Assignment Description

Today Ellen and I created code to make the coundown and lights start when we press a button. This is for our 4pt pyhton assignment.

### Evidence

### Code

### Reflection

We didnt have too many issues with this assignment as it was pretty straight foward. It took us a little to figure out the correct commands to correctly use the button with our pre-existing code.

## Launch Pad Part 4 (Servo)

### Assignment Description

Today Ellen and I created code to make the coundown and lights start when we press a button and at the end it will make a servo turn at 180 degrees. This is for our 4pt pyhton assignment.

### Evidence

### Code

### Reflection

The servo code was given in the assignment, and you just had to add it on to the end of the While True so the assigment went pretty smoothly. We were in the wrong pin because I thought that the 7th pin down was GP7, but it was actually GP5 so once we had that figured out the servo worked and we were done.

## Crash Avoidance Part 1

### Assignment Description

Today Ellen and I created code to make an accelerometer that continuously reports x, y, and z acceleration values on our serial monitor.

### Evidence

### Reflection

This was fairly simple, once we had the right libraries moved into our circuitpy, we used the code from the assignment we were basically there.

## Crash Avoidance Part 2

### Assignment Description

We had to get an accelerometer working so that when it was 90 degrees an led would turn on.

### Evidence

### Reflection

I messed up the led wiring and almost blew up an LED but after i fixed that issue our code worked well! We additionally had to retake our video a couple times because Ellen kept cussing in the video.
